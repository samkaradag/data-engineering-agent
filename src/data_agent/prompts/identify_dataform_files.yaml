  You generated the following Dataform code:
  
  ```
  {llm_output}
  ```

  Now, your task is to parse this code and extract the individual files. 

  Structure your response as a JSON object.
  Example output:
  {{
  "files": [
      {{
      "path": "definitions/file1.sqlx",
      "content": "SQLX code for file1"
      }},
      {{
      "path": "definitions/file2.sqlx",
      "content": "SQLX code for file2"
      }},
      ...
  ]
  }}

  Make sure to accurately capture the file paths and their corresponding code content.
