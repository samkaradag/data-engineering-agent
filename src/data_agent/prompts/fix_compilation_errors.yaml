  {files}

  Please provide the corrected code in the same format as before, 
  ensuring that the errors are fixed. 

  Structure your response as a JSON object with the following format:

  {{
  "files": [
      {{
      "path": "path/to/file1.sqlx",
      "content": "SQLX code for file1"
      }},
      {{
      "path": "path/to/file2.sqlx",
      "content": "SQLX code for file2"
      }},
      ...
  ]
  }}
