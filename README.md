I have the new york taxi trips data in a table named tlc_green_trips_2022. I want to create a star schema to answer some questions based on the dimensions; date, month, year, passenger_count and dropoff_location_id. Build the star schema and necessary pipelines.

I need to create data vault modelling. I have table named tlc_green_trips_2022. Build the data vault model and pipelines to populate data vault. 

I want a pipeline to prepare data for ML forecasting model. Create data preperation and future engineering pipelines that processes tlc_green_trips_2023


I have the new york taxi trips data in a table named tlc_green_trips_2022. I want to create a star schema to answer some questions based on the dimensions; date, month, year, passenger_count and dropoff_location_id. Build the data vault model and pipelines to populate data vault. Than build the star schema on top of data vault. Than build a denormalized table for ml training with all the necessary features engineered in a data product layer using the star schema. Build all the necessary pipelines.


I need to add a new feature called taxi plate number to green trips table tlc_green_trips_2022. Add this and update the existing pipelines.







<!-- I have yearly tables in the dataset new_york_taxi_trips. table names end with _YYYY. Create the SQLX for a view  that has union of all the tables i.e: tlc_green_trips_YYYY -->


How can I get most profitable taxi rides based on dropoff_location_id






**1. Source Datasets and Tables (Bronze Layer):**

* We know the source table is `binance.price_history_hr`.  I need to know:
    * **The schema of `binance.price_history_hr`:**  What columns does it contain?  Crucially, it must include at least a timestamp column and a price column.  Please provide the table schema.  (e.g., `timestamp TIMESTAMP, symbol VARCHAR(10), open_price DECIMAL(18,8), high_price DECIMAL(18,8), low_price DECIMAL(18,8), close_price DECIMAL(18,8), volume DECIMAL(18,8)`).
    * **Database type:**  (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake, Postgres, etc.) This will influence the specific SQL used.
    * **Data location:** Is it a cloud storage location, or a database?


**2. Transformation Requirements for the Curated Zone:**

* **Bollinger Band Calculation:**  To calculate Bollinger Bands, we need a moving average (typically a simple moving average) and the standard deviation over a specified period.  
    * **Window size:**  What is the desired window size (number of periods) for calculating the moving average and standard deviation?  (e.g., 20 periods, 50 periods)
    * **Which price to use:** Should we calculate the Bollinger Bands using the `open_price`, `close_price`, `high_price`, or `low_price`?  Or a different calculation such as average price?
    * **Standard Deviations:** How many standard deviations above and below the moving average should the upper and lower bands be? (e.g., 2 standard deviations is common).

**3. Final Data Structure for the Data Product Zone:**

* I assume we want a table with the Bollinger Band data.  
    * **Table Name:**  What should the name of the resulting table be?
    * **Granularity:** Should the output be at the same granularity as the input (hourly)? Or aggregated (e.g., daily, weekly)?
    * **Schema:** The final table will likely contain columns such as `timestamp`, `symbol`, `moving_average`, `upper_band`, `lower_band`, potentially other relevant columns from the source.  Confirm the desired schema.


**4. Additional Processing Requirements:**

* **Handling Missing Data:** How should missing data be handled during the moving average and standard deviation calculations?  (e.g., ignore, fill with previous value, interpolation)
* **Performance:** For large datasets, we might need to optimize the query for performance. Partitioning, clustering, or using appropriate window functions will be considered.
* **Data validation:** Are there any data quality checks we should perform before or after the calculation?
